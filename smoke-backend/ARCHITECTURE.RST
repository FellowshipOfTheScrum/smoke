==================
Smoke Architecture
==================


Purpose
-------

Smoke is a web application which will allow teachers and
students to create environments to learn any programming
language, all without the hassle of having to download and
install any software; free of any system dependencies, to be
fully OS agnostic.

Smoke will facilitate the learning of languages,
test driven development, and coding by being more accessible;
all of these, done thorough a web browser with an internet connection.

RST Syntax Examples
===================

You can use ``backticks`` for showing ``highlighted`` code

one asterisk: *text* for emphasis (italics),
two asterisks: **text** for strong emphasis (boldface), and


Structural Elements

      (i) (lower roman)

          A. upper alpha.

             I) upper roman)

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indicated with a double-colon ("::") at the end of
the preceding paragraph (over there ``-->``).  They can be indented::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Or they can be quoted without indentation::

>> Great idea!
>
> Why didn't I think of that?


Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)
