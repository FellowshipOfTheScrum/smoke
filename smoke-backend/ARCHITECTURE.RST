Purpose
========
Smoke is a web application which will allow teachers and
students to create environments to learn any programming
language, all without the hassle of having to download and
install any software; free of any system dependencies, to be
fully OS agnostic.

Al of this will help facilitate the learning of languages,
test driven development, and coding at a more accessible level,
all of these done thorough a web browser with an internet connection.
